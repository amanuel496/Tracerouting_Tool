This program is written in python language(version 3) and implemented in kali linux machine. 
It is a command line traceroute tool that implements both UDP and ICMP methods. It is converted to 
an executable file using pyinstaller, but did not work for me, I think it is related to pyinstaller module. 
I have included both the source code and executable files inside a folder, please feel free to try it. 
If the executable program does not work, try using the following command:
$ sudo python3 troute.py <destination_address>
replace <destination_address> with the desired server address.
for example: $ sudo python3 troute.py google.com
